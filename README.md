#Monty

#Description
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.
It includes the following commands:
- push
- pall
- pint
- pop
- swap
- add
- nop
#Examples
- push is a command that pushes to the stack.
Usage:
$ push 1
$ push 2
The previous script will push 1, then 2 to the stack.

- pall, will print them in reverse order - the last one pushed to the stack first and vice versa.
Usage:
$ pall
2
1
